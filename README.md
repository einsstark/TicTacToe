# TicTacToe

Just a simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game.

I made this back in 2023 when I was still figuring out how to code in Python.

The idea was to let two players take turns, choose positions on a 3x3 grid, and the game checks who wins. That’s it.

## Why I’m uploading this

Not because it’s impressive — it’s really not.

But this is part of my journey. I’m uploading all the small projects I did over the years so I can look back later and track how far I’ve come. That’s the whole point.
